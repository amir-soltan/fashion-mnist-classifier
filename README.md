A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch to classify clothing items from the FashionMNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be used for image classification. The model is trained on the FashionMNIST dataset and predicts one of ten clothing categories from grayscale images.

## Dataset

FashionMNIST contains:

- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 testing images
- 10 classes
- 28×28 grayscale images

### Classes

- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results

The Convolutional Neural Network achieved the following performance on the FashionMNIST test set:

| Metric            | Value  |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Training Loss     | 0.3088 |
| Training Accuracy | 88.78% |
| Test Loss         | 0.2853 |
| Test Accuracy     | 89.63% |

The model successfully learned meaningful visual features from FashionMNIST and generalized well to unseen test data.


### Key Takeaways

* Achieved nearly 90% classification accuracy.
* Demonstrated effective feature extraction using convolutional layers.
* Maintained similar training and testing performance, indicating limited overfitting.


## Future Improvements

- Data augmentation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model comparison experiments
